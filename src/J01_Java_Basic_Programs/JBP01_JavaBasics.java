        package                 → Groups related classes together in a folder-like structure.
                                  i.e. "Folder name for the class."

        J01_Java_Basic_Programs → Name of the Package.

        public                  → Access modifier that makes a class or method visible to all other classes.
                                  i.e. “Visible to everyone, even JVM.”

        class                   → Blueprint to create objects; it defines variables and methods.
                                  i.e. “Blueprint box for code.”

        JBP01_JavaBasics        → Name of the Class.

        static                  → Belongs to the class, not to an object; can be called without creating an object.
                                  i.e. “Runs without object.”

        void                    → Return type that means the method does not give back any value.
                                  i.e. “Returns nothing.”

        main                    → Special method where the Java program starts execution.
                                  i.e. “Program’s starting door.”

        String\[] args          → Array of strings that stores command-line arguments passed to the program.
                                  i.e. “Carries inputs from command line.”
